# zkp-cli

A cli toolkit for zkp.

*Currently zkp-cli uses the already implemented gadgets as separate circuits for a simple demonstration. As more zkp algorithms are added in the future, we will refactor and add more features to zkp-cli.*

## Usage

- **YOU NEED TRUSTED-SETUP** to run Groth16 scheme
  - `cargo run --bin setup groth16 bls12_381 hash` (Proving key and verification key will be generated in the `setup_files` directory)
  - The random common reference string (CRS) generated in this way is for testing purposes only. These parameters would have to be generated securely by a trusted setup, which is normally through a trusted third party or a multi-party computation.

- Use groth16 as scheme and bls12_381 as curve, and prove knowledge of the preimage of a MiMC hash invocation which is the secret string.
  - `cargo run --bin zkp-prove groth16 bls12_381 hash iamsecret` (A proof file will be generated at `proof_files` directory)
  - `cargo run --bin zkp-verify proof_files/groth16-bls12_381-hash.proof.json`

### setup

```
setup

Usage: setup [SCHEME] [CURVE] [CIRCUIT]

SCHEME:
