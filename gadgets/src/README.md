## How to write zkp-toolkit gadget

In zkp-toolkit, there is a trait called ConstraintSynthesizer. To complete the verification in Groth16, it is necessary to inherit this trait. Under this trait, there is a function `generate_constraints`, which implements the construction of the circuit for with or without the substitution of the witness. It will be used twice, once in the setup phase, the witness is set to None, and once when the proof is generated and the witness value is substituted for specific calculations.

```rust
/// Computations are expressed in terms of rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS).
/// The `generate_constraints` method is called to generate constraints for
/// both CRS generation and for proving.
pub trait ConstraintSynthesizer<F: Field> {
    /// Drives generation of new constraints inside `CS`.
    fn generate_constraints<CS: ConstraintSystem<F>>(
        self,
        cs: &mut CS,
    ) -> Result<(), SynthesisError>;
}
```

After implementing the circuit in the `generate_constraints` function above, you may need to test this circuit. The general test steps are as follows:

1. Generate pvk from the generated random value and empty circuit.

```rust
let mut rng = &mut test_rng();
let n = 10u64; // |lhs - rhs| < 2^10

println!("Creating parameters...");
let params = {
  let c = RangeProof::<Fr> {
    lhs: None,
    rhs: None,
    n: n,
  };

  generate_random_parameters::<Bn_256, _, _>(c, &mut rng).unwrap()
};

let pvk = prepare_verifying_key(&params.vk);
```

2. Assign withness to the circuit instance to generate a proof.

```rust
println!("Creating proofs...");

let c1 = RangeProof::<Fr> {
  lhs: Some(Fr::from(24u32)),
  rhs: Some(Fr::from(25u32)),
  n: n,
};

let proof = create_random_proof(c1, &params, &mut rng).unwrap();
```

3. Use vk, proof, and public input to verify that the proof.

```rust
println!("Proofs ok, start verify...");

assert!(verify_proof(&pvk, &proof, &[Fr::from(2u32).pow(&[n])]).unwrap());
```

The rangeproof test sample is as follows:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_rangeproof() {
    use curve::bn_256::{Bn_256, Fr};
    use math::fields::Field;
    use math::test_rng;
    use scheme::groth16::{
        create_random_proof, generate_random_parameters, prepare_verifying_key, verify_proof,
    };

    let mut rng = &mut test_rng();
    let n = 10u64; // |lhs - rhs| < 2^10

    println!("Creating parameters...");
    let params = {
        let c = RangeProof::<Fr> {
            lhs: None,
            rhs: None,
            n: n,
        };

        generate_random_parameters::<Bn_256, _, _>(c, &mut rng).unwrap()
    };

    let pvk = prepare_verifying_key(&params.vk);

    println!("Creating proofs...");

    let c1 = RangeProof::<Fr> {
        lhs: Some(Fr::from(24u32)),
        rhs: Some(Fr::from(25u32)),
        n: n,
    };

    let proof = create_random_proof(c1, &params, &mut rng).unwrap();
    println!("Proofs ok, start verify...");

    assert!(verify_proof(&pvk, &proof, &[Fr::from(2u32).pow(&[n])]).unwrap());
}
```

## Details

### rangeproof

#### Features

Compare the size of two variables (lhs, rhs)

#### Constraint

- Calculate `alpha_packed = 2 ^ n + B - A`, to verify that the two are equal, add a constraint

  `1 * (2 ^ n + B-A) = alpha_packed`

- The alpha array represents the binary representation of `alpha_packed`, to verify that the two are equal, add a constraint

  `1 * sum (bits) = alpha_packed`

- To verify that each bit of the alpha array is binary

  `(1 - bits_i) * bits_i = 0`

  Calculate sum = âˆ‘ bits_i (i = 0..n-1)

  When sum = 0, it means that lhs = rhs, let output = 0, inv = 0

  When sum != 0, it means lhs != rhs, let output = 1, inv = 1 / sum, output (that is, not_all_zeros) indicates whether two numbers are equal.

- To ensure that the output is a binary number, verify

  `(1-output) * output = 0`

- Constrain the relationship between output and sum, there are two equality constraints: when the sum is not 0, the output must be 1

  `(1-output) * sum = 0`

- When sum = 0, the output must also be 0

  `inv * sum = output`

- less_or_eq is alpha\[n], so the relationship between less_or_eq and less can be expressed as

  `less_or_eq * output = less`

- Verify whether the `less` relationship is established: `less * 1 = 1`

### isnonezero

#### Features

Prove if the variable value is non-zero.

#### Constraint

There are two constraints in the gadget in [ethsnarks](https://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks/blob/9cdf0117c2e42c691e75b98979cb29b099eca998/src/gadgets/isnonzero.cpp). X is the input value and Y is the output value. The two constraints are:

- $$ X * (1-Y) = 0 $$

- $$ X * (1 / X) = 0 $$

There is no result output variable Y in zkp-toolkit, so the constraints are:

$$ X * (1 / X) = 0 $$

#### Code

[isnonzero](./isnonzero.rs#L1)

### lookup_1bit

#### Features

The index of array `c` is represented by `b` of 1-bit size, the size of array `c` is 2, and finally, the result r is a specific element in the C array. This is the lookup table gadget as in [ethsnarks](https://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks/blob/9cdf0117c2e42c691e75b98979cb29b099eca998/src/gadgets/lookup_1bit.cpp).

#### Constraint

Input 1-bit `b`, variable array `c`, result value `r`:

$$ (c [0] + b * c [1] - (b * c [0])) * 1 = r $$

- When b is 0, r = c [0]

- When b is 1, r = c [1]

#### Code

[lookup_1bit](./lookup_1bit.rs#L1)

### lookup_2bit

#### Features

The index of array `c` is represented by `b` of 2-bit size, the size of array `c` is 4, and finally, the result r is a specific element in the C array.

#### Constraint

Input 2-bits `b`, variable array `c`, result value `r`:

$$ (c [1]-c [0] + (b [1] * (c [3]-c [2]-c [1] + c [0]))) * b [0] = -c [ 0] + r + (b [1] * (-c [2] + c [0])) $$

The above constraints refer to the implementations in ethsnarks. If the above constraint equation holds, it must be satisfied:

```js
b: 00, r = c [0]

b: 01, r = c [1]

b: 10, r = c [2]

b: 11, r = c [3]
```

#### Code

[lookup_2bit](./lookup_2bit.rs#L1)

### lookup_3bit

#### Features

The index of array `c` is represented by `b` of 3-bit size, the size of array `c` is 8, and finally, the result r is a specific element in the C array.

#### Constraint

Input 3-bits `b`, variable array `c`, result value `r`:

$$ (c [0] + \\ (b [0] *-c [0]) + \\(b [0] * c [1]) + \\(b [1] *-c [0]) + \\(b [1] * c [2]) + \\(b [0] * b [1] * (-c [1] + -c [2] + c [0] + c [3])) + \\(b [2] * ( -c [0] + c [4])) + \\(b [0] * b [2] * (c [0] -c [1] -c [4] + c [5])) + \\(b [ 1] * b [2] * (c [0] -c [2] -c [4] + c [6])) + \\(b [0] * b [1] * b [2] * (-c [0] + c [1] + c [2] -c [3] + c [4] -c [5] -c [6] + c [7])))) * 1 = r $$

The above constraints refer to the implementation of ethsnarks. If the above constraint equation holds, it must be satisfied:

```js
b: 000, r = c [0]

b: 001, r = c [1]

b: 010, r = c [2]

b: 011, r = c [3]

b: 100, r = c [4]

b: 101, r = c [5]

b: 110, r = c [6]

b: 111, r = c [7]
```

### merkletree

#### Features

Given a Merkle tree verification path (Merkle proof), and a leaf node and a root node, verify that the results computed for the leaf node on this verification path are the same as the root node.

#### Constraint

There are 3 types of constraints in merkletree:

- merkletree calculates the constraints of each left_digests and right_digests on the path. Every bit on the hash needs to satisfy `digests[i] * (1 - digests[i]) = 0` so the total number of constraints here is `(2 * digest_size - 1) * tree_depth`.
- A hash constraint from the lowest level of merkletree to the root node tree_depth (where tree_depth is the actual tree height minus 1). Assuming each hash constraint x, the total constraint is `tree_depth * x`
- Determine the left and right positions of the leaf hash node and the internal hash node by the bit of address_bit. The constraint of each hash bit is: `is_right * (right.bits[i] - left.bits[i]) = (input.bits[i] - left.bits[i])` digest_size Constraint, looping tree_depth altogether. Number of constraints: `digest_size * tree_depth`.
- Finally, the hash result calculated by the circuit is compared with the expected hash result. The circuit constraints are: `root_digest[i] * 1 = computed_root[i]` digests_size constraints.

#### Code

[merkletree.rs](./merkletree.rs#L1)

### boolean

#### Features

This boolean logic gadget mainly refers to `bellman/gadget/boolean.rs`. There are various gadget operations on boolean variables, the `Boolean` is the encapsulation of `AllocatedBit`.

#### Constraint

The following bool operations are implemented:

```js
AllocatedBit:
xor: Performs an XOR operation over the two operands
and: Performs an AND operation over the two operands
and_not Calculates: a AND (NOT b)
nor: Calculates (NOT a) AND (NOT b)
u64_into_boolean_vec_le: u64 to Vec<Boolean>
field_into_boolean_vec_le: Field to Vec<Boolean>
field_into_allocated_bits_le: Vec<AllocatedBit>
```

#### Code

[boolean.rs](./boolean.rs#L1)

### mimc

#### Features

[mimc](http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/492) hash function

#### Constraint

```
xL, xR: = xR + (xL + Ci) ^ 3, xL

tmp = (xL + Ci) ^ 2

new_xL = xR + (xL + Ci) ^ 3

new_xL = xR + tmp * (xL + Ci)

new_xL-xR = tmp * (xL + Ci)
```
